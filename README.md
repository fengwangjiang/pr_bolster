# Introduction
This implements several error estimators using several classification rules on synthetic data and real data.

Error estimators include resubstitution, cross-validation, 0.632 bootstrap, bolstered, and new bolstered resubstitution.

Classification rules include linear discriminant analysis, linear SVM, RBF SVM and 3NN.

Synthetic datasets include M1, M2, M3 and M4 in [High-dimensional bolstered error estimation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3198579/) by Sima in 2011.

Real datasets include [breast cancer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11823860) and [lung cancer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11707567).
